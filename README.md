## üìù Notes
Use the flowise-railway template (https://railway.app/template/pn4G8S) if you don't need pre-configured persisted volume, postgis and private networking on Railway.

# Deploy Flowise with Railway

## ‚ú® Features
- Pre-configured persisted volume.
- Most of the Flowise configs are pre-configured.
- Use Postgres/Postgis as the default database for Flowise.
- The communication from Flowise to database is accomplished through the railway internal private network, reducing unnecessary egress fees.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisite
- Postgres or Postgis was already deployed to an environment on Railway
- Flowise and Postgres have to be deployed to the same environment in order to leverage the benefits of private networking on Railway.
- `flowise` database was already created in Postgres

5. Let Railway deploy all the services for you.

6. Once the process is successful, you will be able to view a deployed URL.


### üí° What if I would like to use my current Postgres/PostGIS database server?

1. Click Deploy Now

2. Change to your preferred repository name

3. **(Important)** Configure the database-related environment variables to point to your current PostGIS database.

- `DATABASE_HOST` (Private or public network database host. i.e. `postgre.railway.internal`)

- `DATABASE_NAME` (Database name. i.e. `flowise`)

- `DATABASE_PASSWORD` (Database user password)

- `DATABASE_PORT` (Database private or public network port. i.e. `5432`)

- `DATABASE_USER` (Database user - A database user that allows you CRUD the flowise database)

4. Click Deploy

# Start Flowise with Docker Compose (Local development)

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

1. Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`)
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. You can bring the containers down by `docker-compose stop`

## üîí Authentication

1. Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT`, `FLOWISE_USERNAME`, and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` (refer to `.env.example`)
2. Pass `FLOWISE_USERNAME` and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```
    environment:
        - PORT=${PORT}
        - FLOWISE_USERNAME=${FLOWISE_USERNAME}
        - FLOWISE_PASSWORD=${FLOWISE_PASSWORD}
    ```
3. `docker-compose up -d`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
5. You can bring the containers down by `docker-compose stop`

## üå± Env Variables

If you like to persist your data (flows, logs, apikeys, credentials), set these variables in the `.env` file inside `docker` folder:

-   DATABASE_PATH=/root/.flowise
-   APIKEY_PATH=/root/.flowise
-   LOG_PATH=/root/.flowise/logs
-   SECRETKEY_PATH=/root/.flowise

Flowise also support different environment variables to configure your instance. Read [more](https://docs.flowiseai.com/environment-variables)
