## üìù Notes
Use the flowise-railway template (https://railway.app/template/pn4G8S) if you don't need pre-configured persisted volume, postgis and private networking on Railway.

# Deploy Flowise with Railway

## ‚ú® Features
- Pre-configured persisted volume.
- Most of the Flowise configs are pre-configured.
- Use Postgres/Postgis as the default database for Flowise.
- The communication from Flowise to database is accomplished through the railway internal private network, reducing unnecessary egress fees.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisite
- Postgres or Postgis was already deployed to an environment on Railway
- Flowise and Postgres have to be deployed to the same environment in order to leverage the benefits of private networking on Railway.
- `flowise` database was already created in Postgres

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

### Deploy using Deploy on Railway button
1. Click the Deploy on Railway button
2. Change to your preferred repository name
3. **(Important)** Configure the database related environment variables which to point to your current Postgis database.

- `DATABASE_HOST` (Private/Public network database host, private host is preferred. i.e. `postgre.railway.internal`)

- `DATABASE_NAME` (Database name. i.e. `flowise`)

- `DATABASE_PASSWORD` (Database user password)

- `DATABASE_PORT` (Database private/public network port, private port is preferred. i.e. `5432`)

- `DATABASE_USER` (Database user - A database user that allow you CRUD the flowise database)

4. Click Deploy

5. Let railway deploy your service, most of the configurations are preset, but feel free to tweak them as you like before deployment.


### Deploy through the Railway template page on Railway
1. Click Deploy Now

2. Change to your preferred repository name

3. **(Important)** Configure the database related environment variables which to point to your current Postgis database.

- `DATABASE_HOST` (Internal network database host. i.e. `postgre.railway.internal`)

- `DATABASE_NAME` (Database name. i.e. `flowise`)

- `DATABASE_PASSWORD` (Database user password)

- `DATABASE_PORT` (Database private network port. i.e. `5432`)

- `DATABASE_USER` (Database user - A database user that allow you CRUD the flowise database)

4. Click Deploy

5. Let railway deploy your service, most of the configurations are preset, but feel free to tweak them as you like before deployment.

# Start Flowise with Docker Compose (Local development)

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

1. Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`)
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. You can bring the containers down by `docker-compose stop`

## üîí Authentication

1. Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT`, `FLOWISE_USERNAME`, and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` (refer to `.env.example`)
2. Pass `FLOWISE_USERNAME` and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```
    environment:
        - PORT=${PORT}
        - FLOWISE_USERNAME=${FLOWISE_USERNAME}
        - FLOWISE_PASSWORD=${FLOWISE_PASSWORD}
    ```
3. `docker-compose up -d`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
5. You can bring the containers down by `docker-compose stop`

## üå± Env Variables

If you like to persist your data (flows, logs, apikeys, credentials), set these variables in the `.env` file inside `docker` folder:

-   DATABASE_PATH=/root/.flowise
-   APIKEY_PATH=/root/.flowise
-   LOG_PATH=/root/.flowise/logs
-   SECRETKEY_PATH=/root/.flowise

Flowise also support different environment variables to configure your instance. Read [more](https://docs.flowiseai.com/environment-variables)
